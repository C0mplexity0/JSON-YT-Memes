# JSON-YT-Memes
A series of YouTube memes all in a JSON file. Formatted or minified.

The files contain a series of video IDs (youtube.com/watch?v=\<ID\>) which can be inserted into URLs for use in software. This is to simplify the files and to reduce storage space.

The memes.json file contains the IDs in beautified format, and the memes.min.json file contains them in minified format.

Current counter: ~927 memes
